# JavaScript Calculator

This program is a calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. The user can input numbers and operators by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The program is built using a frontend 
framework such as React and JavaScript. It fulfills a set of user stories that include displaying the current calculation in a specific HTML 
element, centering the layout, and using a clean and minimalist design with a math-inspired background. This project was bootstrapped with 
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
